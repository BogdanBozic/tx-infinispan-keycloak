### Initial kubernetes cluster setup

I will not be dealing with the cluster setup itself, but rather continue on with a working cluster. Initial resources need to be set up manually, while the rest will be handled by ArgoCD.

1. ArgoCD Setup

ArgoCD needs to be deployed manually in this case. Install it as described on their official [docs page](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#1-install-argo-cd).

Overall, all ArgoCD setup is done manually here, for it would have required a lot more work was I to automate everything up to this point and it is not within the scope of the task.
